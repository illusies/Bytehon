  Introduction
++++++++++++++++

This project was born from a desire to learn by teaching in a fun, interactive way. The first phase of the project was meant to be a web application that taught the very basics of the easiest programming language to learn today - Python. The name Bytehon (pronounced By + thon) was chosen because it is a play on the word Byte and the word Python. The second phase of the project was to create a mobile application where users could interact with the main web application and learn to code on the go. The third phase would introduce the Intermediate level of the Web Application and then the mobile application. The Advanced phase with its mobile counterpart would follow. Other expert levels would be introduced later on such as: Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, etc.

It is the desire of the creators to eventually introduce other programming languages such as: C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Ruby, etc. The goal is to have a full-fledged coding school that teaches the basics of coding to the most advanced levels of coding in a fun and interactive way. The school would be free to all and would be open to all ages and available in all languages.
